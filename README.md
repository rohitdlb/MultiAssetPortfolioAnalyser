pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

- For Mac: 

```bash 
pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
```

Run app.py via the IDE (no parameters required or environment variables )

OR

## Data
Data has been sourced from multiple sources in web, namely:
- https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/106
- https://investing.com


## About the Indices Data
All data ranges from Jan 1st, 2001 to Jan 1st, 2025 on monthly basis. 

Data has been collated for 7 indices namely:
- Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJIA)
- NASDAQ Composite (tech & growth; 3000 stocks)
- Russel 2000 (Small Cap)
- Russel 1000 (covers 92% of US mkt cap)
- SNP500 (Top 500 US companies)
- SNP_MID_400 (SNP Top 400 mid-cap companies)
- MSCI_WRLD_GLOBAL (Global Index)

Exceptions:
- Russell 1000 data is missing for dates before 2008-12-01
- MSCI_WRLD_GLOBAL data missing before 01-08-2004


## About the Macro Input Data

All data ranges **from Jan 1st, 2001 to Jan 1st, 2025** on **monthly basis.** 
Data is available as of 1st day of the month for entire period
Data for CPI, US_DEBT, US_DEBT, US_GDP start from 1950s onwards, but data from 2001 is only used

**Exceptions:**
- US CPI Data available on and before Dec 1st, 2024
- US Effective FED Rates Data available on and before Dec 1st, 2024
- US Employment Data available on and before Dec 1st, 2024
- GDP Data available on quarterly basis - last data point is 2024-07-01 (not used for analysis)
- US Debt Data available yearly as of 09/30 for each year (not used for analysis)
- Bitcoin data available only since 2008 Aug 1st (not used for analysis)


## Database
- The project uses **sqlite3** - a **relational database** which creates a local **relational database**.
- On Application startup, the database is created and corresponding tables as required.
- The Database is populated using a series of utility functions on server startup by itself.
- Once done, database creation and data population would not be required on subsequent server startups


## Source Code Architecture
- The web dashboard is a **Dash Application** (built on top of Flask)
- On interaction with web dashboard, callbacks are sent to the backend.
- Code is structured in a modular manner to enable ease and reusability.
- Documentation (**Python docstring**) has been added for important functions
- Code is structured in the following manner:
  - Front-end dashboard (layout)
  - **Controller** (callbacks)
  - **Services** (gets request from controller). Multiple services are created based on their functionalities
  - **Repository** -> responsible for DB operations
  - **Utils** folder has common utilities and constant used across .py files


## Modelling Factors for Portoflio Returns
- Train data uses 180 monthly observations
- Due to insufficiency of train data, we are not doing train and test split. However, the same has been done during research separately
- Fresh model is calibrated each time user sends inputs to the back-end from the **Dashboard**
- Portfolio returns are computed for the rolling window provided by the user for each month - 
  - Given the user input (holding amounts for each constituent), no of units of each constituent are fixed across time to compute rolling returns
- Independent variables are also rolled for the rolling window provided by the user

## User Input on Dashboard
- Analysis Date should be from 2018-2024 to allow 180 monthly observations during model training
